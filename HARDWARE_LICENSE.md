CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S-2.0)

Preamble

The CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 â€“ Strongly Reciprocal (CERN-OHL-S-2.0)
is a strongly reciprocal licence. This means that if you make changes or additions to the licensed hardware and distribute or share the modified designs, you must also licence your changes or additions under the CERN-OHL-S-2.0.
This is similar to a "copyleft" software licence.

1. Definitions

1.1. "Licence" means this CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal.
1.2. "Licensor" means the person or entity providing the Hardware Documentation under the terms of this Licence.
1.3. "Licensee" means any person or entity exercising rights under this Licence.
1.4. "Hardware" means the designs, products, components, or other works whose Hardware Documentation is licensed under this Licence.
1.5. "Hardware Documentation" means the design documentation, such as schematics, layouts, mechanical designs, software, firmware, and other design specifications, which is licensed under this Licence.
1.6. "Distribute" means to make available to a third party, or to convey possession of, the Hardware Documentation or Hardware.
1.7. "Make" means to produce, procure, or to have produced or procured, the Hardware.
1.8. "Produce" means to manufacture or fabricate.
1.9. "Distribute and Make" means any act of distributing the Hardware Documentation or Hardware, and/or making the Hardware.
1.10. "Derivative Hardware Documentation" means Hardware Documentation that is based on the Hardware Documentation provided by the Licensor, including but not limited to modifications, adaptations, improvements, or translations.
1.11. "Recipient" means any person or entity that receives the Hardware Documentation or Hardware.

5.1. In no event shall the Licensor be liable to the Licensee or any other party for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, data, or other intangible losses, arising out of the use or inability to use the Hardware Documentation or the Hardware, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
